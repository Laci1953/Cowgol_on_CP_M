The original game was written by David C. Oshel in 1986
A VT100 version was later published by Anna Christina Nass.
I ported-it to HiTech C in 2023, adding also game save/load options.

Now, it is ported also to Cowgol.

It shows how to use the Cowgol language 'interface' feature to call subroutines using pointers.
